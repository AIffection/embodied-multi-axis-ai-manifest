## 💡 Mission Statement

This is not just a thought experiment.  
It’s a call to those who feel that current AI is missing something essential — something *human*.

This manifesto challenges you to go beyond the limits of today’s LLMs and to envision a new kind of artificial mind: one rooted in emotional feedback, embodied perspective, and recursive reflection.

The proposed three-axis model is not a finished product — it is an invitation.  
An invitation to experiment, to build, and to imagine what AI could become if we dared to ask the questions others avoid.

**If this vision resonates with you, you know what to do.**
